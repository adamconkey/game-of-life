# Conway's Game of Life

This repository contains implementations of Conway's Game of Life in different programming languages. I'm doing this in part to learn different languages, and in part because I think it's a fun and interesting concept.

Right now there's only a basic Python implementation. I'll be adding new features and languages as I go along.
